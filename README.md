## 💎 Why Thread Collaboration?

Because a single voice creates a message,  
but **a team creates a masterpiece**.

This plugin empowers communities to:

- Co-write stories & roleplays  
- Build collaborative tutorials & guides  
- Run shared announcement or team leader threads  
- Work like a **living wiki**, but inside MyBB
