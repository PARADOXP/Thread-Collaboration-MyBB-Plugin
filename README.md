# Thread-Collaboration-MyBB-Plugin
Thread Collaboration allows multiple users to work together on the same thread with assigned roles, permissions, and integrated collaboration tools. The thread creator can invite other members as co-authors, editors, contributors, or support roles. Each collaborator can be granted different levels of editing control depending on the role assigned.
